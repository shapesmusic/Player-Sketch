    <em>Medieval and Renaissance theories of mode are primarily melodic (horizontal), but this theory adds a harmonic (vertical) dimension. How do we reconcile these seemingly incompatible conceptions of mode?</em>
    <br><br>
    Earlier conceptions of horizontality and verticality come along with their own sets of rules, and both are represented in the notion of the "avoid" note. An "avoid" note invokes the rules of voice leading and counterpoint (horizontal) just as well as it invokes the rules of triadic chord structures (vertical). But Russell wants to shift our focus to a much more fundamental rule—a tonal gravity broadly conceived, that is agnostic to horizontality or verticality.
    <br><br>
    One innovation of the theory is to express verticality using the exact same terms as horizontality—the mode. So it's possible to imagine a matrix of tonal gravity, with a vertical and a horizontal axis, moving in time. Gravitational centers (tonics) on the vertical axis become tensions (degrees), pulling toward higher-level gravitational centers on the horizontal axis.
    <br><br>
    But events on the vertical axis unfold in time as well, and verticality is itself an abstraction—a suspension of time that allows for the grouping of events into a definable unit. That unit of verticality can expand across a broader stretch of time, and before long, it starts to become indistinguishable from a horizontal axis. There's the beautiful verse from Parsifal, "here time becomes space," except perhaps here in an inverted form in which space becomes time.
    <br><br>
    So verticality and horizontality each describe a segmentation of time. Each musical event is infused with the gravity of the moment it occurs (vertical), but is also intimately connected to the gravity of every other moment of the work (horizontal). A field theory!

    <em>How might "blue" notes or other pitches in-between the notes of equal temperament operate within this theory?</em>
    <br><br>
    In his <a href="LCC_1959.pdf#page=94" target="_blank">River Trip</a> analogy, Russell suggests two different types of abstraction: the local chord level to the wider key level, and the local mode to the wider Lydian Chromatic. A musician like Coleman Hawkins stays close to the chord and close to the mode, and Ornette Coleman is at the opposite end of both spectrums.
    <br><br>
    There can also be abstraction in the opposite direction. Just as a mode is a gravitational center for chromatic pitches, each equal tempered pitch is a gravitational center for all the pitch frequencies surrounding it. A "blue" note becomes a means of moving in between the gravitational fields of different modes, only now this is done from "inside" the mode, rather than from "outside."
    <br><br>
    In both cases, the equal tempered mode isn't meant to be the structure within which you play, but rather, the terms by which you can locate your playing. The utility of equal temperament is to create a rational, closed system with discrete and distinct parts—and this system is a permission to move beyond itself.

    <em>How does the conversion from chord to scale work? Is the root of the chord also the root of the scale?</em>
    <br><br>
    A chord derived from a parent mode is an expression of that mode, and inherits the same root. But deriving the mode from the chord is not always as straightforward. There are countless instances where one person will label, say, a GM7 chord, and someone else will call it B minor, and still someone else will call it E minor. In these cases, a triadic chord structure is often inferred from a recording or performance, and then assigned a root note based on the most probable function of that chord in the key.
    <br><br>
    When we let go of triads and their functional roots, and instead say that one note of the chord is “emphasized,” the full sound of the parent mode begins to emerge more clearly. Imagine you have a C Major triad, and the “E” is emphasized, either rhythmically, or timbrally, or because it’s in the bass, or because of its amplitude. There would be an argument that this is a <em>phrygian</em> chord, because the broader field of pitches implied by the chord are anchored more strongly to E.
    <br><br>
    This way of thinking invites a more nuanced sensitivity to the tonal tensions that comprise a mode, and takes the place of calculating triadic inversions and functional roots. Function emerges as the same feeling of gravity at a higher, “key” level. And of course, what one improviser imagines to be the gravitational center may be different from what another improviser imagines, or from what that same improviser might experience as a listener.

    <em>Isn't something lost when you bring the notes of a triadic extension back down into a scalar octave? How do we reconcile this tension between scalar thinking, which relies on octave equivalence, and triadic extension, which does not?</em>
    <br><br>
    A parent mode (or polymodality) is an idea that <em>precedes</em> that of scale. It’s not a scalar constraint, but a field of pitches, yet unordered, which means they’re also not yet assigned to an octave. So a chord structure, whether triadic or not, can have the essential qualities of its voicing (a “flavor”) that extends beyond a scalar octave, and can still be an expression of “the sound of” a parent mode. It’s as though Russell had said “if you press down <em>all octaves</em> of all notes of the C Major scale at once…”
    <br><br>
    One question this raises is whether we wish to capture the nuances of a voicing—of a particular expression of a mode—in a chord symbol. If that voicing is more than a straightforward triadic extension, it may make most sense to express it using staff notation (as Wayne Shorter often did). But the staff notation might also be supplemented with a mode symbol, and this opens up an additional field of notes not in the voicing, but still compatible with its parent sound.
    <br><br>
    Another consideration is whether octave may play a role in how we hear a chord and how we understand its context. For example, is there a circumstance where we might hear the notes <em>C, E, G, Bb, D, F#, A, C</em> not as a single Lydian Dominant chord, but as two separate Dominant chords (the first beginning on C and the second beginning on D one octave above it) sounding simultaneously? In that case, what might be the external factors (in the music, or in the listener's experience) that would cause it to sound that way, or that would lead to a rational interpretation of this sort?
    <br><br>
    It may be possible that if two separate tonal contexts were established, and brought gradually toward each other such that this chord was the point of their convergence, it would cause us to think of the chord (and perhaps also to hear it) as two simultaneous chords. And in that case, octave separation may not matter at all—the chords could be layered together as a cluster within one scalar octave (all the notes of a "Lydian Dominant" mode), and would still sound like two Dominant 7th chords. Does anyone know of such a "convergence cluster" in jazz harmony, or would someone like to cook one up to try out?

    <em>How might the Lydian Chromatic and its idea of tonal freedom relate to broader notions of freedom that were very much alive in the late 1950s, especially the Afro-resistance political project at that moment?</em>
    <br><br>
    It's easy to imagine a possible world where the Lydian Chromatic Concept had been read entirely as a political project, or even as a moral philosophy project, cloaked as a method book. In his <a href="LCC_1959.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">introduction</a> to the 1959 edition, Russell writes "it is therefore not a system, but rather a view or philosophy of tonality in which the student, it is hoped, will find his own identity." And in a 1960 Jazz Review interview (which is <a href="LCC_1959.pdf#page=98" target="_blank">included</a> as part of the 1959 edition of the LCC), he says, "Our sense of good and bad is reconstructed every time there is a valid artistic revolution... And that's where we in jazz are today, in an artistic evolution or revolution."
    <br><br>
    On page 174 of the 2001 edition, Russell makes an even larger claim: "In the Lydian Chromatic Concept, you are under the law of tonal gravity and gravity is a huge law. The bigger the law, the greater the freedom. Freedom is not the absence of law; it is the prevalence of a big law over a plethora of small laws. Lack of freedom is therefore the reverse: the prevalence of numerous smaller laws over a big one. The logical conclusion being that tonal gravity is perhaps one of many derivative manifestations of cosmic gravity."
    <br><br>
    These formulations suggest not only a political project, or even an alignment between tonal gravity and a theory of morality, but perhaps something even larger—a kind of metaphysics of morality. The goal-directedness of tonality starts to read, perhaps, as a <em>telos</em> on a cosmic scale, a moral harmony of the spheres, but situated at the level of personal identity—which is aligned, perhaps, with the level of the individual chord.

    <em>How might music pedagogy look in this possible world? Would it look any different from pedagogy in our own world?</em>
    <br><br>
    Glancing through Oliver Hedgerow's comprehensive book <em>Chromatic Polymodality</em> gives a good sense of how pedagogy might work at a more advanced level—a study of the layers of tonal gravity that influence musical events at different levels of abstraction. But there may be an even stronger influence on beginner learning, since the "sound" of a parent mode invites playing by ear as a prereqisite to naming or notating musical ideas.
    <br><br>
    One activity that might become much more commonplace for beginners is improvising along with current pop songs. This is not only because pop songs capture the tonal contexts that are most widely familiar to most listeners, but also because in most pop songs, a single polymodality describes both the key and chord levels, irrespective of chord changes, throughout the full duration of the song. This is an ideal environment to develop the listening and conceptual skills to match musical structures to their parent modes, and to begin to understand the more advanced ways in which these forces operate.
